# GeoBound-AI-Mapping-Project
Hi everyone, I have an idea to combine AI with maps to simplify land surveys. We use maps every day, so why not use them to check property boundaries too? Instead of calling a surveyor, anyone could verify house or farmland borders directly on a map using AI and geospatial data from anywhere in the world.
